# JQuery-HW

This project was from the Chapter 5 week where we discussed and learned about jQuery. 
We were supposed to take exsiting code and refactor the code as well as add code to the JavaScript 
to add some features such as making sure the Date and Time display to the top of the page,
Making sure that when the user adds something to the calander it saves to the local storage on their
personal computers, and making sure that the styles set to each of the different times of the day 
show the correct style.
